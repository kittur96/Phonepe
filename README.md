Phonepe github repository data fetching for insights.


Here's a workflow to fetch the PhonePe GitHub repository directory into your local PC and use Streamlit and Python to extract insights from the fetched data:

Step1-
Clone the PhonePe GitHub repository:

Use the Git command git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/PhonePe.git to clone the repository onto your local PC.
This will create a local copy of the repository's files and directory structure.
Set up a Streamlit project:

Step2-

Create a new Python project or folder on your local PC.
Install Streamlit by running pip install streamlit.
Create a new Python file, e.g., app.py, to write your Streamlit application code.
Import the necessary libraries:

In your phonepe.py file, import the required libraries such as IDE(Visual Studio Code), Streamlit(for sgowing insights on browser), pandas, or any other libraries use for data analysis and visualization.
Load and preprocess the fetched data:

Use the appropriate functions or methods to load the relevant files or directories from the cloned PhonePe repository into your Python code.
Performed  necessary preprocessing steps on the data, such as cleaning, transforming, and organizing it into a suitable format for analysis.
Analyze and visualize the data using Streamlit:

Utilize Streamlit's interactive features to create visualizations, generate insights, and built a user-friendly interface for exploring the data for phonepe.
Use Streamlit's various visualization and interaction options, such as charts, tables, slidebar, and dropdown menus, to showcase the insights and provide an interactive experience for the users.

UI has slidebar which has dropdown options , user can use this dropdown to choose multiple options like HOME,CONTACT US, ABOUT and BASIC INSIGHTS FOR PHONE.
HOME-It has PhonePe information about how the phonepe works and what is it purpose.
ABOUT-This section has information about Phonepe and its founders with donwload button.
CONTACT US-For any issue related to phonepe user can reach out to us for service ,In this email id,kaggle and Hackerrank link are given user can reach out to any of the social media or email id for their concern.
BASIC INSIGHTS ABOUT PHONEPE- This has again dropdown option using which user can get the insights about Phonepe history.

Run the Streamlit application:


Executed the Streamlit application by running streamlit run phonepe.py in your terminal or command prompt.
This will start a local server and launch the Streamlit application in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the data and explore the insights.
Remember to customize the data analysis and visualization steps based on the specific files and directories you fetched from the PhonePe repository. This workflow provides a general outline to guide you in building a Streamlit application for data insights based on the fetched data.
